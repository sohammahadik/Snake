# snake
Traditional snake game created for CIS 120 final project @ UPenn

This game is runnable through the Game.java file. Functions as a typical snake game with movement using the arrow keys 
and score increase when you collide with an yellow apple. There are a few variations: the red squares are enemies that 
randomly move around throughout the game and increase in number as your score increases. The number of apples also increases
throughout the game. The game has live pause and reset features. It also uses file I/O to keep track of high scores on the 
local device. Enjoy!
